       - Upload CSV files with poultry data
       - Automatic data validation and preprocessing
       - Interactive data visualization
       - Basic statistical analysis

    2. **Advanced Analytics**
       - Time series analysis of weight progression
       - Feature relationship analysis
       - Outlier detection
       - Correlation analysis

    3. **Machine Learning Model**
       - Polynomial regression model
       - Feature importance analysis
       - Model performance metrics
       - Model saving and loading capabilities

    4. **Predictions**
       - Single prediction through manual input
       - Batch predictions through CSV upload
       - Prediction history tracking
       - Downloadable prediction results

    ## How to Use

    1. Start by uploading your data in the **Data Upload** page
    2. Analyze your data in the **Data Analysis** page
    3. Train a model in the **Model Training** page
